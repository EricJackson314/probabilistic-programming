# Probabilistic Programming

## Current Tasks

- Fix Big Step Semantics
  - `To-pc` and `To-iid`
- Read `A Probabilistic and Non-Deterministic Call-by-Push-Value Language`
- Read `Geoffroy` section 10
- Write a translation from `PC` to `CBPV` and from `IID` to `CBPV`
  - Start with type translation
  - Follow the Levy thesis translations
  - Get denotational semantics from CBPV
  - Show connection between operational semantics
- CBPV syntax with `coin` and `rand`
  - This semantics will be given by the Giry Monad
- Prove `Γ ⊢_iid e : 𝛕×𝛕' => [e] = μ×μ'`
