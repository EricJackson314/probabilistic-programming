# Probabilistic Programming

## Current Tasks

- Fix Big Step Semantics
  - `To-pc` and `To-iid`
- Write a translation from `PC` to `CBPV` and from `IID` to `CBPV`
  - Follow the Levy thesis translations
  - Get denotational semantics from CBPV
  - Show connection between operational semantics
- CBPV syntax with `coin` and `rand`
  - This semantics will be given by the Gery Monad
- Prove `Γ ⊢_iid e : 𝛕×𝛕' => [e] = μ×μ'`
