# Notes for 2021 Jan 07

## Goal

Adapt `CBPV` to Probabilistic Programming.

- Define a Syntax
- Define a Denotational Semantics
- Prove a few properties

## Example 1

```
let x = flip in x and x
```

Under Call-By-Name, this is equivalent to

```
flip and flip
```

Under Call-By-Value, this is equivalent to

```
flip
```

## Example 2

```
(* precondition: exists n such that l[n] = x *)
let rec random_search l x =
    let n = uniform 0 (length l - 1) in
      if l[n] = x then n else random_search l x
```

Under Call-By-Name, `random_search` returns a random number.

Under Call-By-Value, `random_search` returns the index of `x`.

## Example 3

```
let x = uniform 0 1 in (x, x)
```

Under Call-By-Name, `(x, x)` is uniformly disributed on the unit square.

Under Call-By-Value, `(x, x)` is not uniformly disributed on the unit square.

## Example 4

Consider the following ocaml snippits:

```ocaml
# let x = print_endline "x", print_endline "y" in print_endline "z"; x
y
x
z
- : unit * unit = ((), ())
# let x = print_endline "x" in x, x
x
- : unit * unit = ((), ())
```

Under Call-By-Name, the evaluations would be different.

## Tasks

- Read chapters 1-3 of `Levy Thesis` to learn about Call-By-Push-Value (`CBPV`).
- Read `Basic Category Theory` to learn about Category Theory.
- Read chapters 1 and 2 of `Foundations of Probabilistic Programming` to learn about Denotational Semantics and Probabilistic Programming.
- Learn about how monads are used in Probabilistic Programming.

## Questions

- What is a monad?

```ocaml
module type Monad = sig
  type 'a t
  val (>>=)  : 'a t -> ('a  -> 'b t) -> 'b t
  val return : 'a -> 'a t
end

module Writer : Monad = struct
  type 'a t = 'a * string
  let (>>=) (x, s1) f = let y, s2 = f x in y, s1 ^ s2
  let return x = x, ""
end

module Option : Monad = struct
  type 'a t = Some of 'a | None
  let (>>=) x f = match x with Some v -> f v | None -> None
  let return x = Some x
end
```

Monad Laws:

```
1. return x >>= f ~ f x
2. m >>= return   ~ m
3. (m >>= f) >>= g ~ m >>= (fun x -> f x >>= g)
```

- What is the syntax and semantics of `CBPV`?
